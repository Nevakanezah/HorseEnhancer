*All-natural horse enhancement, adding horse genders, lineage tracking, better breeding, and powerful commands!*

# What is HorseEnhancer?
Horse enhancer is a Spigot/Bukkit plugin that modifies the behaviour of horses in Minecraft in order to enhance horse-related gameplay, and enable an equestrian economy.
The plugin has been tested for Minecraft versions 1.12 - 1.14.
Improvements include:
* Horses now have genders, and require compatible mates to procreate.
* Foal attributes use a more deterministic formula, with a configurable potential for improvement/regression over their parents' attributes.
* Configure the rate at which males spawn, increasing the desirability of stallions.
* View detailed horse information by shift-right-clicking with a clock, including parentage, attributes, and owner.
* Geld males you've tamed by shift-right-clicking with shears, ensuring control over your prized bloodlines.
* Horses track who their parents are, and inbreeding is... inadvisable.
* Disables shooting your own mount in the back of the head.

# How to install

* Option to refund the breeding item when incompatible horses attempt to breed.
* Different horse breeds have different attribute trends.

# Special Thanks
Special thanks to the following plugin authors, whose work was an invaluable resource:
* A Flying Poro, for her extensive assistance.
* [AnomalyTea's Horse Inspector](https://github.com/AnomalyTea/Horse-Inspector) - From whom I drew much inspiration on how to design this plugin.
* [Soiyeruda's Better Horses](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/better-horses.2477/) - Whose attribute determination formula I used in this plugin.
* The human-readable [ProQuints IDs](https://arxiv.org/html/0901.4016) project on Arxiv; whose work was adapted for use in generating horseIDs, and whose authors I've avoided naming for fear of impinging upon their software license.
